## Housing Finders

My primary responsibility in this project was designing and styling the websiteâ€™s pages, as well as implementing key interactive features. I created the main user interface, ensuring the pages were visually appealing and intuitive to navigate. Beyond aesthetics, I also developed a powerful search filter that became our "secret sauce." This feature allowed users to refine their housing searches based on criteria such as price range, location, and property type, making the platform much more user-friendly and effective. Crafting the filter required significant effort, as it involved integrating front-end elements with backend logic to ensure accurate and dynamic results. I took great care to make the filter responsive and easy to use, as we believed this feature was essential to distinguishing our platform from similar applications.Here is a link to the source code for my group project: https://github.com/house-finders/house-finders
