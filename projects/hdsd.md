Keno game implemented using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java Swing. The game allows players to select 10 numbers from a grid of 40 buttons, place bets, and play against the computer. The program simulates the Keno game by randomly generating numbers for both the player and the computer, and highlights matching numbers in different colors. The player's balance is updated based on the number of hits, following a defined payout structure. The GUI includes options for submitting bets, canceling them, viewing instructions, and saving the game's results to a text file. The game offers the player the opportunity to play multiple rounds, and if the player chooses to end the game, the application gracefully terminates.
