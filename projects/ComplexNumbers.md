This C++ code defines a Complex class that models complex numbers and enables various arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The class has private member variables real and imaginary to store the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It provides a default constructor to initialize both parts to zero and a parameterized constructor to set custom values for these components.

The code overloads the stream extraction operator (>>), allowing users to input complex numbers in the form a+bi, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part. It also overloads arithmetic operators like +, -, *, and / to enable complex number operations. The equality (==) and inequality (!=) operators are also overloaded to compare two complex numbers by checking whether their real and imaginary parts are equal.

The program is designed to handle complex number input/output, perform basic arithmetic, and compare complex numbers for equality or inequality. Through these features, it enables a range of calculations and operations on complex numbers in a user-friendly format.
