# Reflecting on AI in ICS 314

## I. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly transformed education, particularly in fields like Software Engineering, where problem-solving, coding, and learning new tools are central. AI tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, and GitHub Copilot are becoming invaluable for students and developers to streamline workflows and enhance understanding.

In ICS 314, I relied on AI tools—primarily ChatGPT—for various tasks. These included writing code, debugging, understanding complex concepts, and preparing for WODs (Workouts of the Day). This essay reflects on my experience using AI tools in specific course elements and analyzes their influence on my learning journey.

## II. Personal Experience with AI
Here, I discuss how AI supported (or did not support) my tasks across different course elements. Specific prompts and examples are included for each case.

### Experience WODs (e.g., E18)
I used AI whenever I was in a pickle and could not figure something out. AI helped me on numerous occasions, especially when I needed styling to be done on a website. For instance, I would ask: “How can I center a div in CSS?” or “What properties do I need to align text and images side by side?” The AI provided solutions that were clear and easy to implement, which saved me time and frustration.

**Benefit:** It provided quick solutions when I was stuck and improved my efficiency.  
**Cost:** Over-reliance on AI for styling could limit my ability to explore alternative solutions independently.

### In-class Practice WODs
Using AI during in-class practice WODs was very beneficial because it saved so much time. On multiple occasions, it drastically cut the time down by about 30 minutes by giving us a basic skeleton that we could use and add on to. For example, I asked: “give me the code to make a navbar and footer.” This allowed me to focus on refining and adding the necessary functionality.

**Benefit:** It significantly reduced the time spent on setup, allowing more focus on enhancing the solution.  
**Cost:** Relying on AI for skeleton code sometimes prevented me from fully understanding the underlying logic.

### In-class WODs
Using AI during timed in-class WODs helped refine my code and lessened the stress as the clock ticked down. If I was ever confused as to why my code wasn’t working, AI would be able to tell me where the issue was. For example, I asked: “Why is this background not being applied to the page?” This saved me on many occasions by pinpointing errors quickly and helping me debug under pressure.

**Benefit:** It reduced stress and provided clear solutions during critical moments.  
**Cost:** Frequent use of AI during WODs might prevent me from fully developing my debugging skills.

### Essays
For writing essays in ICS 314, I used ChatGPT to draft outlines and refine my thoughts. ChatGPT provided me with plenty of references that I expanded on with the knowledge that I had. AI also helped me in refining my writing to make it sound more technical grammar-wise.

**Benefit:** Enhanced organization and clarity of ideas.  
**Cost:** Required careful editing to ensure alignment with course objectives.

### Final Project
For the final project, I used ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to troubleshoot errors and optimize code. There would be plenty of instances where we had to learn new coding knowledge outside of school material and would have no idea how to implement or fix errors, and that's where AI would help us and explain step-by-step what we needed to do.

**Cost:** Overconfidence in AI-generated code led to minor errors.

### Learning a Concept / Tutorial
When learning concepts like functional programming, I used ChatGPT for simplified explanations. The response given by AI clarified confusing concepts in a relatable way, making it easier to digest and comprehend.

**Benefit:** Improved understanding through clear analogies.

### Answering a Question in Class or Discord
I often consulted AI before answering questions on Discord to ensure I understood the topic. Also, when the class would be given a prompt about something we were not too familiar with, using AI was the best way to gain an understanding as quickly as we could. ChatGPT provided an explanation I could simplify when responding to peers.

### Asking or Answering a Smart Question
I used AI to refine questions before posting. The AI response helped me answer smart questions by giving an abundance of examples and references that I could branch out on.

### Coding Example
For coding examples, I used prompts like: “Give an example of routing this code to another page.” This provided quick, useful snippets. The example clarified how to apply the method, and I adapted it to fit WOD instructions.

### Explaining Code
I often asked AI to explain code snippets I didn’t fully understand. The explanations were clear and helpful for reinforcing my understanding. AI provided breakdowns of each component, improving my comprehension.

### Writing Code
I frequently used ChatGPT and Copilot for code snippets and suggestions. The AI-generated solution was almost always functional but required a few tweaks to ensure it fit the perfect layout in mind.

### Documenting Code
For writing comments and documentation, I used AI for formatting and grammar. AI was able to explain what I coded and how it’s being used better than I could have explained it, making it as simple to understand in the quickest manner possible.

### Quality Assurance
I used AI to troubleshoot code issues like:  
 *"Why is this code throwing a TypeError?"*  
ChatGPT identified potential errors,saving me debugging time.

### Other Uses in ICS 314
For time management, I used AI to summarize ideas or other prompts to save me time.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding
Using AI tools greatly influenced my learning experience. It accelerated problem-solving and comprehension of challenging concepts. For example, AI clarified functional programming, helping me complete WODs faster. However, over-reliance on AI sometimes hindered my problem-solving growth. I realized that while AI is helpful for understanding syntax or debugging, solving problems independently built deeper knowledge.

---

## IV. Practical Applications
Outside ICS 314, I used AI for personal purposes, and the advantages it provided were the same as in class: simplifying technical problems for easier understanding.

---

## V. Challenges and Opportunities
### Challenges
- **Over-reliance:** Using AI sometimes reduced critical thinking and creativity.
- **Accuracy:** AI solutions were not always correct, requiring tweaks in the code.
- **Ambiguity:** AI responses were occasionally too generic for specific problems.

### Opportunities
- AI can serve as a personalized tutor for learning concepts.
- Integrating AI tools into the curriculum can better prepare students for real-world software engineering.

---

## VI. Comparative Analysis
### Traditional Methods
Traditional methods, like manual debugging or research, foster critical thinking and deeper learning. However, they can be time-consuming and frustrating.

### AI-Enhanced Methods
AI tools provide instant feedback, examples, and explanations, accelerating the learning process. While engagement increases, students may skip critical problem-solving steps.

---

## VII. Future Considerations
AI will play a central role in software engineering education. Future advancements could include:
- **AI-integrated IDEs** for real-time coding assistance.
- **Adaptive learning platforms** that adjust to individual needs.

Challenges like ethical AI use and preventing over-reliance should be addressed.

---

## VIII. Conclusion
Reflecting on my experience in ICS 314, AI tools like ChatGPT have been both beneficial and challenging. They enhanced my ability to solve problems, understand concepts, and write efficient code. However, balancing AI assistance with independent learning remains important. To use AI integration in future courses, educators should encourage critical thinking while leveraging AI’s potential to accelerate learning.

---

**Recommendations:**
1. Integrate AI-focused exercises alongside traditional methods.
2. Emphasize verifying AI-generated solutions for accuracy.
3. Use AI tools as a supplement, not a replacement, for independent learning.

**Final Thought:** AI is a powerful tool that, when used thoughtfully, can transform how we learn and apply software engineering principles.
