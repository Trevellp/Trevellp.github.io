So far, I’ve found TypeScript to be an interesting and helpful tool for coding. Compared to languages like C++, TypeScript feels more structured because of the way it uses types. It helps keeps the integrity of the type that will be used in the program, like a number or a string. At first, it seemed a bit tricky if you're used to languages like Python or Java because of syntax differnces that could be seen in typescript but, I see how it helps prevent bugs and makes my code clearer. I like that it adds an extra layer of safety by checking for errors before the code even runs which I believe is called static typing and it's a really big help.
Before learning TypeScript, I only knew the bare fundementals of JavaScript, so the transition wasn’t too hard. One of the cool things I’ve picked up from this module is how TypeScript builds on what I already know from JavaScript but adds some neat features like static typing and interfaces. From my perspective, I think TypeScript is a good language because it encourages cleaner, more predictable code, which is really important when working on large projects with other developers.

As for the athletic software engineering, I think the practice WODs (Workout of the Day) are a fun and effective way to learn. They remind me of little coding challenges where you have to complete a task within a certain time limit. At first, I felt a bit pressured because you're racing against the clock, but after doing the first WOD, I realized it’s a great way to improve speed and accuracy in coding. Especially, with all the encouragement from the professor and resources that we are given the pressure diwindles, and it pushes me to think faster and be more efficient with my code, which is important when working on real-world projects where time is often limited.
I actually find this style of learning enjoyable because I usually work better when I'm feeliing pressured, especially once I get the hang of it. The timed aspect adds a bit of worriedness, but it’s also a great way to learn from mistakes quickly. I think this approach will work well for me, as I tend to learn best when I'm actively practicing and pushing myself. Plus, seeing my progress over time is really motivating.

In conclusion, both TypeScript and athletic software engineering have been valuable experiences so far. TypeScript is a solid language for building reliable software, and the WODs are a unique and challenging way to sharpen my coding skills. I believe they’ll make me a better, faster, and more thoughtful programmer in the long run.
