i dunno what happening

The question "How to get current formatted date dd/mm/yyyy in JavaScript and append it to an input [duplicate]?" is not the best way to ask for help on a forum. When asking a smart question, it's important to be clear, show what you've already tried, and be polite. Right away, the problem with this question is using the word “[duplicate]” in the title. This tells people that the person asking knows the question has already been asked before, but they still ask without explaining why the other answers don’t work for them. This makes it seem like they haven’t tried to find the answer on their own.

The question also doesn’t give enough details. It’s important to explain exactly what part of the problem you’re stuck on. Are they having trouble formatting the date or adding it to the input field? Or maybe they’re seeing an error? Without more information, people have to guess what the real problem is, which means they might not give the right answer. It’s always helpful to give some background and explain what’s going wrong.

Another issue is that the person asking the question didn’t show any effort. When you ask for help, it’s good to show that you’ve already tried something. For example, they could have shared a bit of code they tried and explained what wasn’t working. This helps people know where to start and how to help. If you don’t show that you’ve put in effort, it can feel like you just want someone else to solve the problem for you, and people might not be as eager to help.

The question is also very generic. Many people have asked how to format dates in JavaScript, so this question doesn’t stand out. To get better answers, it helps to ask something more specific, like explaining the exact challenge. Maybe they’re trying to format the date in a specific way, or they need to use it in a form. Sharing those details helps others give better advice instead of repeating what’s already been said a lot.

Finally, the question isn’t very polite. While being polite might seem like a small thing, it can make a big difference. Saying things like “Thank you for your help” or “I really appreciate any advice” shows that you’re grateful for people’s time. Being polite makes people more willing to help. In the end, asking a smarter question means giving more details, showing you’ve tried to solve it yourself, and being kind to the people who are helping you.
