The question "How to get current formatted date dd/mm/yyyy in JavaScript and append it to an input [duplicate]?" is not the best way to ask for help on a forum. When asking a smart question, it's important to be clear, show what you've already tried, and be polite. Right away, the problem with this question is using the word “[duplicate]” in the title. This tells people that the person asking knows the question has already been asked before, but they still ask without explaining why the other answers don’t work for them. This makes it seem like they haven’t tried to find the answer on their own.

The question also doesn’t give enough details. It’s important to explain exactly what part of the problem you’re stuck on. Are they having trouble formatting the date or adding it to the input field? Or maybe they’re seeing an error? Without more information, people have to guess what the real problem is, which means they might not give the right answer. It’s always helpful to give some background and explain what’s going wrong.

Another issue is that the person asking the question didn’t show any effort. When you ask for help, it’s good to show that you’ve already tried something. For example, they could have shared a bit of code they tried and explained what wasn’t working. This helps people know where to start and how to help. If you don’t show that you’ve put in effort, it can feel like you just want someone else to solve the problem for you, and people might not be as eager to help.

The question is also very generic. Many people have asked how to format dates in JavaScript, so this question doesn’t stand out. To get better answers, it helps to ask something more specific, like explaining the exact challenge. Maybe they’re trying to format the date in a specific way, or they need to use it in a form. Sharing those details helps others give better advice instead of repeating what’s already been said a lot.

Finally, the question isn’t very polite. While being polite might seem like a small thing, it can make a big difference. Saying things like “Thank you for your help” or “I really appreciate any advice” shows that you’re grateful for people’s time. Being polite makes people more willing to help. In the end, asking a smarter question means giving more details, showing you’ve tried to solve it yourself, and being kind to the people who are helping you.

The question "If I have HTML like this... Is there a way to get (and possibly remove, via something like .text('')) just the free text within a tag, and not the text within its child tags?" is a smart question in my opinion. First, the person asking the question starts by giving a clear example of their problem. They show a small piece of code with an HTML <li> element and some <span> tags inside it. This makes it really easy to understand what they’re working with, which helps anyone who wants to answer or gives their output.

Next, the person explains exactly what they are trying to do. They want to use function to get only the text that isn’t inside the <span> tags. By explaining what they’ve already done and what result they are getting as we can see from the snippet of code that he is showing us, it helps others understand where the problem is happening. Being specific like this is a good way to ask for help especially when you know where the problem is located.

Another reason this is a smart question is because the person shows they’ve already tried something. They mention that when they use $('#list-item').text(), they get more than just the free text, they get all the text inside the <li>, including the text from the <span> tags. By sharing what they’ve done, they show they’ve put in effort, and they aren’t just waiting for someone else to do the work for them.

The person also does a good job of explaining what they want to happen in the future. They say that not only do they want to retrieve just the free text, but they also might want to remove it later using something like .text(''). This helps people who are answering to think about both parts of the problem and offer better solutions. Giving this kind of extra detail makes a question more complete.

Lastly, the person asking the question is polite and respectful. They don’t demand an answer or say it’s urgent. This kind of tone makes people more likely to help. By being clear, showing effort, and being polite, this question stands out as a smart one, which will likely get helpful responses.
