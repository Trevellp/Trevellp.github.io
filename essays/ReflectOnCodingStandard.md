After my first week of using ESLint with VSCode, I’ve found it to be a mix of both helpful and frustrating. ESLint is really useful when you don’t have a tool like Copilot to guide you through errors or make suggestions. It catches mistakes early, which helps improve the overall quality of the code. However, I’ve also found it inefficient at times, especially when it flags small things like an extra blank line as an error. This can feel unnecessary, especially when I’m focused on bigger issues in the code.

That said, despite its occasional annoyances, I think ESLint plays an important role in maintaining coding standards and improving the learnability of the language. By enforcing good practices, it helps users develop cleaner, more reliable code. Even though getting rid of every ESLint error can sometimes feel like extra work, it ultimately helps build habits that lead to better, more maintainable.


Coding standards are what programmers follow to keep their code neat, organized, and easy to read. These rules help everyone write code in the same way, making it easier for people to work together on projects. Also, standards tell us how to name variables or where to place certain symbols like braces {}. When everyone follows these guidelines, it becomes much simpler to understand and fix each other’s code. This is especially helpful when multiple people are working on a big project or when you need to come back and update your code later.

One tool that helps programmers stick to these coding standards is ESLint. ESLint works by constantly checking your code to make sure it follows the rules. It can spot problems, like a missing semicolon or an extra blank line, and remind you to fix them. At times, ESLint might feel a little too strict, flagging small things that don’t seem important, but these details actually help make the code cleaner and more reliable over time.

By following coding standards, programmers can avoid common mistakes and bugs in their code. Standards encourage good habits, like writing clear and descriptive names for functions or making sure the code handles errors properly. This consistency makes code easier to understand for other programmers and for your future self when you revisit old projects. It also helps new developers learn how to write code in a way that others can easily follow, which is really important when you’re just starting out.
In the end, coding standards are about more than just making the code look nice. They help improve the quality of the code, make it easier to work on projects with others, and even make programming easier to learn. Tools like ESLint may seem strict at times, but they play an important role in helping programmers stick to good practices, ultimately making the code better for everyone.
