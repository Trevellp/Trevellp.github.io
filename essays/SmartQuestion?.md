I’ve always been fascinated by how computers work and how we can use them to solve real-world problems. Software engineering allows me to turn ideas into programs or apps that people can actually use. Whether it’s creating a game, building a website, or automating a task, there’s something exciting about writing code and seeing it come to life. It’s like solving a puzzle, but with the added fun of creating something new and useful.
Right now, I’m familiar with programming languages such as Java, c++, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I’ve built programs,  and even manage to built a small game. While I enjoy these projects, I know there’s a lot more to learn.

Looking ahead, there are a few key skills I want to improve. First, I want to learn more about system design, which means figuring out how to build large, complicated programs that work smoothly and can handle a lot of users. I also want to get better at algorithms and data structures, which are like the building blocks of good code. Learning how to solve tricky coding challenges will help me tackle more advanced problems. Another area I’m excited about is probably app development whether it's learning the front or backend of the program.

In the future, I also want to explore machine learning and cybersecurity. Machine learning is all about teaching computers to learn from data, and it can be used in really cool ways, like recognizing images or making recommendations. Cybersecurity is important for keeping apps and systems safe from hackers. I believe that learning these skills will help me become a better engineer and allow me to build software that’s not only smart but also secure and reliable.
